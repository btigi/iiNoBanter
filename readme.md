# No Banter

No Banter is a small mod for Baldur's Gate 2 that  disables party banter. While party banter can be immersive and revealing, it can also break immersion. How likely is it that party members would begin a banter while exploring a dark forbidding dungeon? Or while sneaking through an enemy stronghold? Or while disguised in a drow stronghold?
