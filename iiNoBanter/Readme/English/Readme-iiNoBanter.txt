+) Section 1. About
===================
  iiNoBanter is a small mod to disable party banter. While party banter can be immersive and revealing, it can also break immersion. How likely is it that party members would begin a banter while exploring a dark forbidding dungeon? Or while sneaking through an enemy stronghold? Or while disguised in a drow stronghold?


+) Section 2. (un)Installation
==============================
  To install, simply unzip the archive, named in the form iiNoBanter(xx).zip [where (xx) represents the release version], to the main game directory (i.e. where you installed BG2), run the  Setup-iiNoBanter.exe file, and follow the prompts.

  To uninstall, simply run the Setup-iiNoBanter.exe file and follow the prompts (choosing the Uninstall option).


+) Section 3. Components
========================

A) No Banter
  This is the only component. It disables party banter.


+) Section 4. Known Issues / Future Plans
=========================================
This mod may not affect some (or all) banters.

If you find any errors, please let me know immediately, specifying as much as you can about your problem.

A future version of the mod would disable banters only in certain area types (e.g. dungeons) or through conversation with the PC.
